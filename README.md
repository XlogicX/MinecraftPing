MinecraftPing
=============

Harvesting ping responses from minecraft servers

mc-ping.pl is just a skeleton for how to do Minecraft ping using perl sockets

minecraft.pl will go through a list of IP's and give results in csv freindly output.

Unless you're using a bleeding edge version of nmap, add the contents of nmap-service-probes-mc to the end of your /usr/share/nmap/nmap-service-probes file
This -sV probe has been committed, but likely wont show up in distro packages for a bit
